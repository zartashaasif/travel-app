            You have heard it many times. Employers want to hire people with
            work experience. All those years of getting your degree seem to
            suddenly count for nothing. How do you get the work experience if no
            one will give you a job? References from your Working Traveller work
            placements will show future employers you have the work ethic, or
            even better, the skills they need. Your references show how you use
            your skills: how punctual you are: if you have a good work ethic and
            if you can make decisions. If you take a picture with your host
            doing the WT hand sign, it 100% proves you were there. To find work
            placements from hosts that need your skills, check the work search
            section.
